At this stage, I only have a dictionary of 1,000 words and limited ability to match letters, but I hope to add the following functionality over time:  
    - Reflect matches to number, so if there are two letter e's in a word, it will show no more than two matches.  
    - Show entries in the same styling as results  
    - find a source for the dictionary that I could use for both final result and interim word checks
